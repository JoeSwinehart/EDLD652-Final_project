# Create Plot 1: DV is Intention to vaccinate their fictional children.
# P.S. I cannot rename one of my variables: from "Ã¯..GenConBlf" into "GenConBlf". If you could, please let me know.
#Weird, it comes across correctly for me, so I just changed the lines in question.
#Strengths: The color scheme for this first visualization is really pleasing to me. The range of colors goes together nicely, and it looks like it might be reasonably colorblind friendly as well.
#Possible improvement: I would like to know more about how the Y-axis is quantified.
